# Notes_view_using_FastAPI
In this project, I have created a web application for keeping your notes using the FastAPI and also we can fetch, create, delete and modify the Notes.
And then we keep it them in our notes in Mongodb as database.

Services on this web application:

1. GET: To fetch your notes on homepage
2. POST: To create new notes in database by filling the form.
3. DELETE: To delete the notes from database using the Discard page.
4. PUT: To modify your notes from the update page.
