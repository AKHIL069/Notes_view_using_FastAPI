# Notes_view_using_FastAPI
In this project, I have created a web application for keeping your notes using the FastAPI and also we can fetch, create, delete and modify the Notes.
And then we keep it them in our notes in Mongodb as database.

First we need to create a virtual environment for python3.10.
Then we need to activate the virtual environment.
after that we need to install some python library for using FastAPI.

- pip install fastapi
- pip install ptdantic
- pip install pymongo


Services on this web application:

1. GET: To fetch your notes on homepage
2. POST: To create new notes in database by filling the form.
3. DELETE: To delete the notes from database using the Discard page.
4. PUT: To modify your notes from the update page.
